- Utilizes XR Interaction Toolkit for interactive elements.
- Assets sourced from the Minneapolis Institute of Art and SketchFab, ensuring high-quality 3D models.

## Challenges Faced

- Sourcing appropriate assets that fit the historical context.
- Technical issues related to scene rendering across different devices.
- Hardware failures that impacted project timelines.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance graphics with higher resolution textures and PBR materials.
- Develop smoother transitions between scenes.
- Expand the number of exhibits and interactive elements within the museum.

## Conclusion

Xplora leverages VR technology to create an engaging educational tool that transforms how history is learned. By gamifying the experience through quizzes and interactive exhibits, it aims to capture the attention of users and foster a deeper understanding of art and invention history.
